📌 Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis in E-Commerce
📝 Project Overview

This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to an e-commerce dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The objective is to identify high-value customers, detect at-risk groups, and optimize marketing strategies using data-driven insights.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python  — Data analysis, preprocessing, RFM calculations

Jupyter Notebook  — Exploratory data analysis, methodology implementation

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  — Data manipulation & visualization

Power BI  — Dashboard creation & interactive insights

Git & GitHub  — Version control & project documentation

📂 Dataset

Description:

Covers transactions between 01/12/2010 – 09/12/2011 for a UK-based non-store online retailer

Key fields: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

Preprocessing steps:

Removed missing values, duplicates, and canceled orders

Handled non-product stock codes

Converted invoice dates into datetime format

🛠 Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preparation
Ensured dataset consistency and reliability for analysis.

RFM Feature Engineering

Recency (R): Days since last purchase

Frequency (F): Number of purchase occasions

Monetary (M): Total spending amount

Customer Segmentation

Assigned RFM scores

Classified customers into actionable groups (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, etc.)

Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

Found that 26% of customers contribute to 80% of sales.

Found that 21% of products generate 80% of revenue.

Found that 23% of products contribute to 80% of sales volume.

🤔 Why Pareto Principle over other frameworks?

I chose the Pareto Principle because:

It directly highlights the imbalance in contribution (few customers/products drive most revenue).

Unlike clustering or arbitrary grouping, Pareto is easy for stakeholders to interpret and act on.

It connects naturally with business decision-making (prioritizing top contributors).

Alternative principles (e.g., cohort analysis, long-tail distribution) are valuable, but Pareto offers quick, high-impact insights in e-commerce contexts.

📊 Visualizations & Dashboard

Customer Trends: Purchase behavior patterns over time

Heatmap: Correlations between Recency, Frequency, and Monetary

Segmentation: Distribution of customers across RFM groups

Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Sciler for region, date, product categories

🚀 Key Insights

Top 26% of customers drive ~80% of sales → high-value target group

At-risk customers identified → opportunity for retention campaigns

Loyal and frequent buyers → potential brand ambassadors

Pareto analysis showed marketing budget should focus on the top-performing products & customers
